# Snap - Social Media App

Snap is a social media app that lets you share your beautiful photography with the world. The app is built using the MERN stack, and you can use your email or social media accounts such as Google or Facebook to register.

## Features

- Secure user registration and login with email and social media accounts.
- Upload your photography to the app and showcase your talent to the world.
- Download photos shared by other users and use them as your wallpaper or screensaver.
- Save photos to your own gallery and come back to them anytime you like.
- Search for photos and filter them by category, so you can find exactly what you're looking for.

## Technologies used

Snap is built using the latest and greatest technologies to provide you with a seamless user experience. I used:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores all your data.
- Express.js: A popular web application framework used to build robust and scalable APIs.
- React: A powerful JavaScript library used to build intuitive user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that runs your server-side code.

In addition to these technologies, I also used Cloudinary to store all the images uploaded by users.
